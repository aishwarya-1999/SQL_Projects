## Problem Statement
**Problem Statement:**

Danny's Diner has collected basic operational data over the past few months but lacks the expertise to analyze it for business insights. The goal is to use this data to understand customer behavior, specifically focusing on visiting patterns, total spending, and favorite menu items. These insights will enable the diner to build stronger connections with customers, offering more personalized experiences, especially for loyal patrons. Additionally, this analysis will assist in determining whether to expand the existing customer loyalty program. To facilitate this, the data needs to be transformed into easily accessible datasets for inspection by Danny's team, eliminating the need for SQL queries.

## Data Tables
The 3 Key Datasets available are:
1. sales
2. menu
3. members

And the entity relationship Diagram is as shown below

## Questions To Be Answered
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
